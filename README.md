# Gorilla in the Jungle
### An unfinished project created using Java
This project was created as a final project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class and met the standards of the assignment.
However, it is an unfinished project as I would like to add true gameplay, although can be run in a stable condition in its current state.

### Gameplay Description
A gorilla, named DK, can be moved around the screen and interact with the
banana and tree game objects, resulting in a short line of dialogue to be
displayed.

### Controls
- Use **WASD** to move the gorilla across the screen
- Use **SPACEBAR** to interact with the banana or tree
- Use **ESC key** to exit the program.
- Use **M** to display the current coordinates of the mouse cursor
